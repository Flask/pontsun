# Installation for MacÂ 

## Requirements

- Homebrew: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)
- Ruby (install latest version with Homebrew as OS version is
  obsolete)

## Docker

Download Docker installer at
[https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg)\
Follow the installation procedure (the Docker installer may propose to
create a Docker account at some point but this is not required).\

Once installed and launched, update preferences:

- Uncheck "Send usage statistics"
- File sharing: check that this checked-out project is below one of
  the exposed folder or add it

## Docker sync

Docker sync tends to solve bins mounts performance on Mac.

```
gem install docker-sync
```

## Dnsmasq

Dnsmasq will automatically forward any **\*.docker.test** domain to our
local docker infrastructure.

```
brew install dnsmasq
```

```
mkdir -pv $(brew --prefix)/etc/
echo 'address=/docker.test/127.0.0.1' > $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
echo 'strict-order' >> $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
```

```
sudo cp -v $(brew --prefix dnsmasq)/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
```

```
sudo mkdir -v /etc/resolver
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolver/docker.test'
```

## Trust certificates

```
chmod u+x ./scripts/generate-certificates.sh
./scripts/generate-certificates.sh
```

You need to add the generated certificate
**certificates/docker.rootCA.crt** to your certificates:

- Double click on the certificate, this should open Keychain Access
- Add the certificate to **system**
- Double on the docker.lo certificate under the system tab to open the
  details
- Trust \> When using this certificate, set **Always Trust**
